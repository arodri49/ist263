    <h2>Personal Info</h2>
    <p>My name is Alexandra Rodriguez and I am currently Junior at <strong>Syracuse University.</strong> I am a Finance major in the Whitman School of Management and have just begun my minor, Information Management and Technology, in the iSchool. I am interested in how the principles of finance intertwine with the world of technology in the workplace. In terms of experience, I am currently the bursar for my sorority on campus. This position allows me to handle the budgets, dues and expenses for this organization. In 2018 I was certified in Excel giving me the ability to succeed within this position. Besides academics, I have experience in the food industry spanning over a four-year period. This has allowed me to advance my communication and customer service skills. Outside of my responsibilities I recently ran a virtual half marathon where all proceeds were donated to the Black Aids Institute. I am extremely family oriented, and both my parents and sister have encouraged me throughout all of my endeavors. A quick story about me, I was born with a cataract in my right eye. My mother is a teacher at the New York Institute For Special Education where she works with blind and special needs children. Essentially, she was able to recognize my issue before I turned one and, in turn, I was immediately treated for it. I hope this gives a little insight into my life.   </p>
