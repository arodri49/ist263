            <h3>The Wage Gap</h3>

            <p>The gender wage gap is the difference in earnings between men and women. The World Economic Forum predicts that it will take another <strong>217 years</strong> before the gender pay gap finally closes. </p>

            <a href=https://futurewomen.com/hotlists/5-reasons-gender-pay-gap-exists/ >5 Reasons the gender wage gap exists</a>

            <h3>Reasons for the wage gap</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Discrimination.</strong> Gender bias is still very much alive whether people are conscious of it or not.</li>
                <li> “Only 19% of civilian workers had access to paid family leave through their employers and only 40% had access to short-term disability insurance benefits to deal with their own medical needs” This leads to men having more years of experience. </li>
                <li>Industries that are predominately women such as childcare, education etc. tend to pay lower wages than industries dominated by men including trading, construction, etc.</li>
                <li>Even though men and women are recorded to be performing the same, men are receiving more bonuses.</li>
                <li>Having children, in most cases, causes mothers to work less making it more difficult for them to advance in their careers.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Researchers for the University of Exeter found that gender bias still exists due to managers and corporate leaders who believe gender bias is no longer a problem. 

                The study involved managers within the veterinary field. 
                
                A group of managers were given 2 identical candidates one female one male for a specific position.

                https://www.theladders.com/career-advice/workplace-gender-bias-is-very-much-alive-and-well-and-this-is-why"> Their findings included:</a>
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Rating the male candidate more competent </li>
                <li>Suggesting an 8% higher salary to the male candidate </li>
                <li>Majority of the managers who deemed the female candidate less competent also said they did NOT believe gender bias still existed </li>
                <li>2/3 of managers who said gender bias is not an issue were male </li>
            </ul>
