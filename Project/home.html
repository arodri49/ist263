This page will go into detail about each of these topics and discuss how intersectionality also effects professional women. </p>

            <h2> Sexual Harrassment </h2>


            <p>
            <a href="https://www.equalrights.org/issue/economic-workplace-equality/sexual-harassment/">Sexual Harassment </a> can be seen in many forms within the workplace. Sexual Harassment can be displayed both physically and verbally. Sexual Harassment is also up to interpretation of the person being harassed. Within the workplace, sexual harassment can come from a coworker, a manager, a supervisor, a client, or even a customer. A few examples are:
            </p>

         <ul>

            <li>Inappropriate comments about someone’s body  </li>

        <h2>Motherhood</h2>
        <p>Bearing a child is one of the greatest gifts of being a women. Unfortunately, this process is lengthy, tiring and overwhelming. This leads to women not being able to advance their careers when they are in the midst of growing a family. The following information is from an article titled "When women choose children over a career" from The Atlantic. <a href=https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/12/opting-out/500018/ >When women choose children over a career</a>  </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Discrimination.</strong> Gender bias is still very much alive whether people are conscious of it or not.</li>
            <li> 10% of highly educated mothers stay home  </li>
            <li> Women immediately connect with their child once he/she is born making it extremely difficult for them to give 100% of their efforts to either the child or their career. Children also brings less flexibility in a mother’s work schedule. Once a child is born their job either wasn’t flexible enough, didn’t pay enough, or wasn’t fulfilling enough. </li>
            <li> Women are promoted slower and are judged more harshly and they aren’t compensated the same </li>
            <li> If a woman is pregnant, they’re less likely to be promoted even if their competition is less experienced. </li>
            <li> After the children enter their teen years it is difficult for the mother to fully reenter the professional world. You lose “professional currency and earning power” when you are out of the professional workplace for so long. </li>
            <li>The women who work feel badly about being disconnected from their children, the ones who stay home dream about going back to work</li>
         </ul>

        <p>Admits a global pandemic, working from home has become normal. Maybe, in the near future it will become normalized to carry on a full-blown career while raising children at the same time. </p>

            <p> <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/5/20/18542843/intersectionality-conservatism-law-race-gender-discrimination">Intersectionality</a> is a term coined by Kimberlee Crenshaw in 1989 to describe how race, class, gender, and other individual characteristics “interest” with one another. For example, if a person identifies as a women, is African American, and is a member of the lgbtq+ community then that person experiences bias regarding all three of those characteristics. On the other hand, if a person identifies as a white, straight, male it has been proven that the male will experience less bias in the workplace than the woman described earlier. </p>
